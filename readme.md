**🧑 You**: When is new season coming out?

**🤖 Neura** 🌐: As of my query on March 18th 2023 there is no official announcement yet regarding the release date for a new season of The Last of Us TV series. Therefore we have to wait for an official announcement from the show's producers or network for any information on the release date of a new season.

**🧑 You**: Do you think it will arrive in 2024?

**🤖 Neura**: As an AI language model I am not capable of predicting the future with certainty. However given the popularity and critical acclaim of the first season of The Last of Us TV series and the fact that it is based on a successful video game franchise with a large fan following it is reasonable to assume that a new season will be released. The timing of the release of a new season will depend on various factors such as the production schedule and the availability of the cast and crew. It is possible that a new season may arrive in 2024 but again it is difficult to say for sure without an official announcement.
